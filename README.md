# conFusionRestaurant

This project is developed as part of a Coursera course I am pursuing titled 'Front-End JavaScript Frameworks: AngularJS' by by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
A few parts of the code contain starter code that the course instructor provided. 

The learning outcomes are:
- To set up, design and style a single page application using AngularJS
- Enable client-server communication between your Angular application and a RESTful server
- Make use of web tools to setup and manage your Angular application.
